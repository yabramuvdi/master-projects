### ***Documenting a master's degree in data science***
---
This repository collects a diverse set of projects developed through the course of my master's in data science at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics (BGSE). Most of the projects were developed in Jupyter notebooks running Python 3.

- **ML Toolbox**: contains practical examples of machine learning models using ***scikit learn***. Additionally, a theoretical notebook on neural networks and a practical implementation using ***PyTorch*** are available.
